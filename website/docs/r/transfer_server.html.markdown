# Resource: aws_transfer_server

Provides a AWS Transfer Server resource.


```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "foo" {
  name = "tf-test-transfer-server-iam-role"

  assume_role_policy = <<EOF
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Principal": {

		"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
		}
	]
}

}

  role = "${aws_iam_role.foo.id}"

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `endpoint_details` - (Optional) The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that you want to configure for your SFTP server. Fields documented below.
* `endpoint_type` - (Optional) The type of endpoint that you want your SFTP server connect to. If you connect to a `VPC_ENDPOINT`, your SFTP server isn't accessible over the public internet. If you want to connect your SFTP server via public internet, set `PUBLIC`.  Defaults to `PUBLIC`.
* `invocation_role` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used to authenticate the user account with an `identity_provider_type` of `API_GATEWAY`.
* `host_key` - (Optional) RSA private key (e.g. as generated by the `ssh-keygen -N "" -f my-new-server-key` command).
* `url` - (Optional) - URL of the service endpoint used to authenticate users with an `identity_provider_type` of `API_GATEWAY`.
* `identity_provider_type` - (Optional) The mode of authentication enabled for this service. The default value is `SERVICE_MANAGED`, which allows you to store and access SFTP user credentials within the service. `API_GATEWAY` indicates that user authentication requires a call to an API Gateway endpoint URL provided by you to integrate an identity provider of your choice.
* `logging_role` - (Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that allows the service to write your SFTP usersâ€™ activity to your Amazon CloudWatch logs for monitoring and auditing purposes.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional) A boolean that indicates all users associated with the server should be deleted so that the Server can be destroyed without error. The default value is `false`.
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
* `vpce_security_group_ids` (Optional) A List of security group IDs to be applied to the automatically created VPC endpoint.

**endpoint_details** requires the following:

* `vpc_endpoint_id` - (Optional) The ID of the VPC endpoint. This property can only be used when `endpoint_type` is set to `VPC_ENDPOINT`
* `address_allocation_ids` - (Optional) A list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach an Elastic IP address to your SFTP server's endpoint. This property can only be used when `endpoint_type` is set to `VPC`.
* `subnet_ids` - (Optional) A list of subnet IDs that are required to host your SFTP server endpoint in your VPC. This property can only be used when `endpoint_type` is set to `VPC`.
* `vpc_id` - (Optional) The VPC ID of the virtual private cloud in which the SFTP server's endpoint will be hosted. This property can only be used when `endpoint_type` is set to `VPC`.

## Attributes Reference
In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Transfer Server
* `id`  - The Server ID of the Transfer Server (e.g. `s-12345678`)
* `endpoint` - The endpoint of the Transfer Server (e.g. `s-12345678.server.transfer.REGION.amazonaws.com`)
* `host_key_fingerprint` - This value contains the message-digest algorithm (MD5) hash of the server's host key. This value is equivalent to the output of the `ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f my-new-server-key` command.

## Import

Transfer Servers can be imported using the `server id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_transfer_server.bar s-12345678
```

Certain resource arguments, such as `host_key`, cannot be read via the API and imported into Terraform. Terraform will display a difference for these arguments the first run after import if declared in the Terraform configuration for an imported resource.
